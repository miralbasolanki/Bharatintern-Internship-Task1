# Bharatintern-Internship-Task1

Hello! I am Miralba Solanki. Welcome to my GitHub repository!

This is the first task of my internship at Bharat Intern, I work on various machine learning projects.

TASK 1: HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION

Develop a machine learning model forpredicting house prices using Python,scikit-learn, and TensorFlow

In this task, I developed a machine learning pipeline to predict house prices using various regression 
models and a neural network, processing the data with scaling and one-hot encoding, and evaluating model
performance based on mean squared error.
